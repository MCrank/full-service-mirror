This directory contains a shell script + associated files for generating a wallet-service-mirror release.
To create a release, run `./create-release.sh [release name]`, e.g. `./create-release.sh wallet-service-mirror-0.6.0`. This will create a directory named `wallet-service-mirror-0.6.0` as well as an archive `wallet-service-mirror-0.6.0.tar.gz`.

If you would like to create only a mainnet or testnet release, then you can run the respective shell scripts for those networks.
